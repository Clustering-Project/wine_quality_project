# wine_quality_project
First team project!

# Regression-Model-Project

## Goal

* The purpose of this model is to group and label data based off the quality.
* My goal is to find specific features that have similarities and group those features and label them using a clustering model.

## Initial hypotheses

* Null Hypothesis: features do not have similarities based off target variable.
* Alternative Hypothesis: features have similarities based off target variable.

## Data dictionary

| Feature               | Description                                                            |

|fixed_acidity          | total amount of acids                                                  |
|volatile_acidity       | measure of volatile acids                                              |
|citric_acid            | measure of natural acid                                                |
|residual_sugar         | amount of sugar remaining in the wine after fermentation               |
|chlorides              | chloride concentration level                                           |
|total_sulfur_dioxide   | total amount of sulfur dioxide                                         |
|density                | mass of the wine per unit volume                                       |
|pH                     | measures the acidity or alkalinity of the wine on a scale from 0 to 14 |
|sulphates              | measure of compounds added to wine as a preservative.                  |
|alcohol                | alcohol by volume                                                      |
|quality                | rating of the wine's overall quality                                   |
|type                   | red or white whine                                                     |


## Planning:
Questions to ask about the data set based off of what I want my model to predict: 
- Do any features have a correlation with quality?. 
- What features significantly affect quality?

- Final report should be in .ipynb, Modules should be in .py, Predictions should be in .csv.
- Audience will be lead data scientist.
- Determine correlation between features and target variable.
- Develop my null hypothsisis and alternative hypothesis.
- Explore data using visuals and statistical tests.
- create model.
  
## Acquisition:
- I registered an account at data.world and downloaded the wine-quality dataset into a csv.
- I used pandas to read in the data onto a jupyter notebook.

## Preparation:
- 

## Exploration & pre-processing:
- Made visuals and used stats to understand which features had a significant correlation, relationship


## Modeling:
-

## Delivery:
- Deployed my model and a created a reproducable report
- Made recommendations

## Key findings, recommendations, and takeaways
- 
## Instructions or an explanation of how someone else can reproduce project and findings

Enviroment setup: 
- Install Conda, Python, VS Code or Jupyter Notebook
- Clone this repo remotely through your terminal (CLI)
